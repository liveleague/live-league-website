          <h4><b>What is Live League?</b></h4>
          <p>
            Live League is the UK's only ongoing <u>'battle of the bands'</u> style
            competition.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Entry is open to artists of any genre and events will
            be hosted by promoters <u>across the country</u>.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Points are allocated to artists when you <u>vote</u> and the number of points
            allocated is <u>equal to the ticket price</u>. For example, a Â£5 ticket gives you
            a vote worth 5 points.
          </p><br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>What are the prizes?</b></h4>
          <p>
            Every time a vote is cast, money is added to the prize pool.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            As the league progresses, <u>sponsorship</u> will play a major role in boosting the prize pool.
          </p><br>
          <br>
          <h4><b>When does it finish?</b></h4>
          <p>
            The first season of the league will last from <u>September 2019</u> to <u>April 2020</u>.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Then, in the summer of 2020, we'll round off the season with a <u>grand finale</u>  . More details to follow.
